The goal of the project was **firmware development** for two different microprocessors, along with **testing and verification** for the **All-In-One Keyboard AIOK**. The project aimed to deliver a **completely integrated access control and intrusion monitoring system**.
The **AIOK device** is a **wall-mounted wireless access control keypad** designed to:
- Protect doorways from unauthorized entry or exit
- Provide access security and event alarming
- Wirelessly transmit data to a central facilities station for monitoring
AIOK installations can consist of a **single unit** or a **dual setup** (Master & Slave), enabling **power sharing** and **event communication** between units.

## My Role:
- Full **firmware development** for two different microprocessors:
  - **Microchip PIC18**.
  - **Silicon Labs EFM8 Sleepy Bee**.
- Implementing features such as:
  - **Detecting, storing, and indicating user events**.
  - **Managing the operator interface** to reprogram device configurations.
  - **Sharing configurations** between Master-Slave devices.
- **Hardware debugging and verification**, ensuring a fully functional product.

Through this project, I successfully developed and delivered a **robust, tested, and verified** firmware solution for AIOK.

## Tools & Technologies
Embedded C, firmware development, MPLAB, Keil, Silicon Labs Simplicity Studio, Microchip PIC18, Silicon Labs EFM8 Sleepy Bee, Touchscreen.
