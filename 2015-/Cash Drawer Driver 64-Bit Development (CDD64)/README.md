# Cash Drawer Driver 64-Bit Development (CDD64)
The primary objective for CDD64 project was **upgrading and modifying** currently used cash drawer **kernel driver** for PAR EverServ 7000 and EverServ 7200 models into a **64-bit driver** using **Kernel-Mode Driver Framework (KMDF)**. The project also required providing **WMI support** for the driver, updating **demo application**, providing support to **debug and test the driver**. An **installation package** was also developed as a part of the project.
