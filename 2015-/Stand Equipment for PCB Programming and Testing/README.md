# Stand Equipment for PCB Programming and Testing
The objective was to develop a **multi-purpose stand equipment** (controlled from PC) for **programming and testing 3 sets of PCBs**. As a major developer I solved a vast number of issues: assisting in **overall design** concept and structure planning, assisting in **hardware design**, **implementing FPGA and MCU firmware, software development and testing**, writing **drivers and GUI**, documentation support. Stand equipment consisted of several independent PCB: Power Board, Control Board, Backplane Board, Analog Signal Board, Stepper Motor Control Board. Hardware/firmware components included **Spartan-II FPGA, 3 CPLDs, 2 Silicon Labs MCU** (C8051F320, C8051F340). Several different methods were implemented to program both internal and external hardware components: **SPI-flash AT45DB041B, I2C EEPROM AT17C/LV, FRAM FM18L08, Spartan-II FPGA, MCU flash, USBXperss bootloader**. I was responsible for **interfaces and dataflow** management across several PCBs (using SPI, UART, I2C, GPIO), created an interface to a host PC via USB. A set of algorithms was developed to verify various aspects of the equipment under test: **signals and busses connectivity, analog signal verification** (waveform generator with programmable characteristics (period, magnitude) and signal shapes (saw, meander, sinus, arbitrary or mixed)); **memory tests; FPGA and microprocessors configuration and unit testing**, etc. Software solutions required overall system control from PC (via USB), GUI interface. Also I was involved in **documentation support** (user manual, technical applications) and performed field-tests.

### My Role
-	Designing **project architecture**.
-	**Hardware design** (partial PCB schematics).
-	Implementing **FPGA firmware** for various **Xilinx FPGAs** (Spartan, Spartan-II) and CPLDs (CoolRunner-II, CoolRunner XPLA3, XC9500XL).
-	Implementing **MCU firmware** (Silabs MCU C8051F32x, C8051F34x).
-	Implementing **PC software with GUI** for operator.
-	Debugging, **verification** and testing.
-	**Mathematical modeling** and simulation of verification algorithms.
-	Technical **documentation support**.

### Tools & technologies
Xilinx ISE, Active-HDL, Keil uVision, MSVC 2008, MFC, MATLAB, USB, SVN, P-CAD.
