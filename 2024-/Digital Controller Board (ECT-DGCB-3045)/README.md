This project required a **full FPGA and Embedded C development** with **board bring-up** for Digital Controller Carrier Board (ECT-DGCB-BB). This Base Board is compatible with **Ectron Digital Controller (ECT-DGCB)** daughter board, as well as **Raspberry Pi\LoRaWAN** boards. It has a rich set of interfaces specifically meant for developing the **IoT applications**: Raspberry Pi HAT, Gigabit Ethernet, USB 2.0, Two Mini PCIe x1 (5Gb), LCD, SD Card, Digital Outputs, Analog&Digtal I/O. It is based on **Zynq 7000 SoC** innovative  platform, offering a combination of powerful **FPGA** and **1 GHz Dual core ARM processor**.

### My Role

- Resolving **schematics** problems.
- **FPGA** development in **Vivado**.
- **Embedded C** *Build-In-Self-Test (BIST)* application in **Vitis** with custom **First-Stage-Boot Loader (FSBL)**.
- Full **board bring up** with **hardware debugging and verifying**.
- Assisting in **PetaLinux** built.
- Technical and documentation support, managing junior developers.

### Tools & Technologies
Vivado, Vitis, Zynq 7000 SoC FPGA, Verilog, Embedded C, Firmware development, BIST, Board Bring-up, FSBL, Petalinux.
