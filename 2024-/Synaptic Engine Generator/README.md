# Synaptic Engine Generation
The objective of the project was **FPGA and Embedded C design, implementation and verification of Synaptic Engine Generator** - a patented neuromorphic graph engine inspired by human brain. It is a highly **reconfigurable FPGA/ASIC** Engine Generation, optimized to **adapt and run a standard algorithm or set of algorithms (C/C++ or Python Development) on dynamically generated custom FPGA/ASIC designs**. It is based on the **scheduling engine technology**, that plugs into the back end of a standard compiler front end, to provide an average of **x6 speedup**, enabling customers an**easy-to-use, low-power high-performance processors with unique architecture**.
The project was tested on various **Altera (Intel) SoC FPGAs (Cyclone V, Arria V, Arria10)** as well as **Xilinx Zynq 7000 SoC**. It was also estimated as a **custom ASIC** solution, providing up to **x15 performance boost**, with low power consumption, targeting various embedded edge processing applications (Image Processing, Machine Learning, Robotics and Controls, Data Analytics and ML).
